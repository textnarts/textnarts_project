            Dummy text is also known as 'fill text'. It is said that song composers of the past used dummy texts as
            lyrics when writing melodies in order to have a 'ready-made' text to sing with the melody. Dummy texts have
            been in use by typesetters since the 16th century.</p> -->

            What's the best strategy to capitalise on this development as smartphone adoption rises quickly around the world? Take advantage of this chance by localising your software.</p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-0 mt-4">Translating and localising your mobile app for various regions and languages is a quick approach to increase downloads and visibility worldwide. Localizing your mobile app can increase downloads, improve rankings in the App Store, and raise your revenue internationally.</p>
            
            <h4 class="my-4">What is localization in mobile apps?</h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
              App localization is the process of modifying a mobile application's functionality and user interface to cater to markets in other languages. Mobile app localization aims to provide an app that:</p>
              <ul class="text-muted">
                <li>considers linguistic, cultural, and technical distinctions</li>
                  <li>doesn't alter the application's original functionality or intent</li>
                  <li>looks and performs as if it were made specifically for the target language
                  </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-muted">Essentially, your app is opened to millions of potential new users. This is the power of app localization.</p>
              
              
              <h4 class="my-4">Why localize your app:</h4>
              
              <h4 class="my-4">Enhance the of international users experience</h4>
              <p class="text-muted">
                Today, applications dominate over browsers on mobile devices, accounting for 90% of all activity. The bulk of programmes are downloaded and then removed, though, in a matter of minutes. </p>
               <p class="text-muted mb-0 mt-4">Therefore, it has never been more crucial to localise your app properly. In the native language of your target audience, a properly translated software has the potential to raise brand value and foster meaningful relationships.</p>
                <h4 class="my-4">Boost app store searchability</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">
                  Both the Google Play Store and the iTunes App Store offer options for localising your app listing to make it easier for overseas customers to find and understand it.</p>
                  <p class="text-muted mb-0 mt-4">As a result, more people will be able to find your programme using keywords in their original tongue, and if they see a welcome message in their own language, they are more inclined to download. Together, these two impacts have the potential to increase downloads by as much as 767 percent.</p>
                  <h4 class="my-4">Multiply app downloads overseas</h4>
                  <p class="text-muted">
                    Localizing your software is one of the most effective techniques to boost the number of downloads. According to a recent Distomo study, localising iPhone application texts can actually multiply downloads by 128 percent and boost income by 26 percent each country.
